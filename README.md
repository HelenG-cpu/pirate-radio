The norns study group Discord is turning 1 year old! To celebrate, we are experimenting with this new group project. Previously we worked on the [song](https://github.com/norns-study-group/song) project. The pirate radio project seeks to build on our experiences with the song project, but is bigger, more ambitious, and more structured.

## Meeting Minutes

[YARRRRR!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jNHnpUeweiwFgerYhkINJbBXRhU_48Kgr6Z3nTv1YW4/edit)

## The Vision

*p2p norns pirate radio: an educational project for new developers to learn how to code*

## The Team

*[pirates...] a shallow and functional hierarchy, risk / reward, collective praxis* - `@syntheist`

- Developers / QA / Support: [All tracked here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sgBaggUcnjZBOgAjG8eIFyYXiv_lspyWofmjwelrVUE/edit?usp=sharing)
- Product Owner: `@obakegaku`. The term [Product Owner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_owner) comes from agile software development practices. POs balance product (usable software) choices with various stakeholder, technical, and team constraints. They are ultimately responsible for shaping the product and ensuring all voices are heard.
- Project Manager: `@tyleretters`. PM's simply keep things on the rails. Since this is an educational project with volunteered time, the main role of the project manager will be ensuring the team has clear objectives and good tooling.
- CTO: `@catfact`. Stares off distantly from the crows nest.

## The Tools

- GitHub: this repository will house the script and will eventually be released on norns.
- Text Editor: Bring your own text editor / IDE. If you don't have one yet, your tutor will help you select one that fits your skill and aesthetic.
- Command Line: Use the command line / terminal to commit your code. Again, your tutor will help you learn git.
- norns / shield: :)

## Goal

Our target launch date be December 31st so we can rrrring in the new year like pirates, arr!
