The norns study group Discord is turning 1 year old! To celebrate, we are experimenting with this new group project. Previously we worked on the [song](https://github.com/norns-study-group/song) project. The pirate radio project seeks to build on our experiences with the song project, but is bigger, more ambitious, and more structured.

## The Vision

*p2p norns pirate radio: an educational project for new developers to learn how to code*

*[pirates...] a shallow and functional hierarchy, risk / reward, collective praxis* - `@syntheist`

## Goal

Our target launch date be December 31st so we can rrrring in the new year like pirates, arr!

# Documentation

## first time starting

the first time you start the *pirate radio* it will take a minute. it will first install nessecary linux tools if not already installed (`vorbis-tools`, `espeak`, `ffmpeg` and `lame`). afterwards it will download available playlists for the different stations.

## uploading your own music

goto [coffer.norns.online/](https://coffer.norns.online/) to upload your own tracks. simply select a station and choose the files. optionally you can add some information about the artist or other info.

## listening to the radio

once the radio is initiated, you'll see a dial. use **E3 to move the dial**. once you hit upon a station you should see the frequency get brigther and the magic eye get smaller. some stations also have some graphics that will appear.

once the radio station is dialed in you should stop hearing radio static and start hearing the radio. 

## equalizer

use **E1 to change to the equalizer page**. on this page **K2 and K3 change equalizer preset** or you can use **E2 and E3 to customize the bands** of the equalizer.

## visualizer

the visualizer shows the relative power of each band. use **E1 to change to the visualizer page**.

## timewarper

the timewarper lets you change, slow down, and reverse time, as well as loop time points. use **E1 to change to the time-warper**.

to make a loop, **press K2 twice to set start and end points**. once a loop is created, you **press K2 to deletel loop**. 

**press K3 once to get back to "live" audio**.

rotating **E2 will slow down and speed up time**. rotating **E3 will change position in time**. as of now, you cannot go into a time in the future.

use the norns TAPE to record your remixed audio.

## effects

in addition to the normal compressor and reverb available on the norns, there are other effects available to add to the pirate radio. go into the parameters menu and you will see delay and granulator effects:
